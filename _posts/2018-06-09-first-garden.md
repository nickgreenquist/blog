# First Attempt at Growing Anything

This journey began during a trip to Costco. I don't know why, but I thought it would be funny to buy a baby tomatoe plant and plant it in my girlfriends family's backyard. After approval from her father (who liked the idea after seeing the first plant), I went to Walmart to stock up. Over the past two weeks, the garden grew larger and larger as we decided to buy one of each type of vegetable (after buying 7 tomatoes). The summer is young so only time will tell if the garden is a success.

Gave the watermelon and cantaloupe a ton of room. Rows of onions on the left. Very annoying to plant each one individually.
