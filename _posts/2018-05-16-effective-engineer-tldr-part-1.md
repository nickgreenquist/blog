*A TLDR of [The Effective Engineer](http://www.effectiveengineer.com/) by Edmond Lau*

Before starting my internship this summer at [Bluecore](https://www.bluecore.com/), I was given this book to read by the team. Instead of just reading through it and probably forgetting most of it within a month, I wanted to do a type of *book report*. Writing down the key ideas and condensing the information into my own words helps with retaining information. We learned about this strategy in my overview of [Learning How to Learn](https://nickgreenquist.github.io/blog/miscl/2018/04/10/Learning-How-to-Learn.html) on how chunking helps make things stick.

## Part 1 - Adopt the Right Mindsets
In the first part of the book, Lau focuses on how you, the individual, can increase your value creation. 

# **Focus on High-Leverage Activities**
Here Lau debunks the myth of the startup or company where engineers work 70-90 hours a week in order to be successful. Instead of pure hours worked, Lau explains how you should instead focus only on *high leverage* activities

### Use Leverage as Your Yardstick for Effectiveness
Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested

80-20 Rule: 80% of your impact will come from 20% of your time. Find what that 20% is! Hint: It's not going through your emails or sitting in meetings.

1 hour each day for 20 days is only 1% of an engineer's yearly hours worked. Yet, 1 hour each day for the first 20 days of an engineer's job can snowball tha learning into massive leverage gains later on. 

### Three ways to Increase Leverage
1. Reduce the time it takes to complete an activity
2. Increase the output of an activity
3. Shift focus to a higher leverage activity

Here are a few tips to accomplish the above:
1. Condense meetings into 30 minutes instead of a half hour
2. Prepare an agenda for meetings to streamline them
3. Replace non-important meetings with emails
4. Automate parts of your development or testing workflow
5. Focus on launch critical tasks
6. Use profiling tools to instantly know where bottlenecks are versus using time finding them

### Focus on Leverage Points, not Just Easy Wins
People think the Leverage equation can be gained by just focusing on a ton of 'low-hanging' fruit. This is wrong as a bunch of small wins will still be eclipsed by large, critical, high impact tasks. 

Tims is like money. You want to invest it in what will give the biggest return. You wouldn't use your days going around collecting quarters off the street. Instead, invest into things with high payouts. 

# **Optimize for Learning**
Learning is the single most important investment you can make in yourself (except maybe health and fitness but there are other books on that). Figure out how to optimize your time so you are learning as quickly and early as possible as knowledge is like money: it has compound interest.

A big factor in deciding to work somehwere is if you think you will be challenged enough to always be learning.

### Adopt a Growth Mindset
Be a [Yes Man](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003L77XB8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) to learning opportunities. I actually did this with my life a few years ago (say yes to everything) and it really does change your life. 

Force yourself to believe that you can always learn new things and skills and that belief will actually get you to to partake in activities that foster growth. 

### Invest in Your Rate of Learning
Learning is like money: it is affected by compound interst. 

Invest early and invest in high return knowledge (things that will make more future learning easier). For me, this is math as many of the things I want to do require a solid foundation in Mathematics. 

### Seek Work Conducive to Learning
We spend most of our waking hours as work. You should find ways to learn while at work. 

Below are criteria you should be measuring when deciding where to work:
1. Fast Growth: is the company growing fast or just kinda floating along?
2. Training: the company should offer extensive training opportunities (not just for new hires!)
3. Openness: Different teams should not be isolated and closed off
4. Pace: you should be able to get things done quickly and not get bogged down by miles of red tape
5. People: never be the smartest person in the room
6. Autonomy: you should have some freedom and say in what you really want to work on

### Dedicate Work Time for Learning
Google's 20% Time: Engineers get one day a week to work on whatever side project they think will help the company in the long run. 

Ten suggestions on how to learn on the job:
1. Study other's code
2. Write more code
3. Go through internal technical documentation
4. Master your most used programming language
5. Ask for code reviews from the harshest critics
6. Enroll in classes (even in nearby University)
7. Participate in design meetings
8. Work on diverse projects (Interleaving from Learning How to Learn anyone??)
9. Make sure your team has at least one engineer more senior than you so you can learn
10. Jump into new code bases without fear

### Always be Learning
You should also be learning outside of work. Even learning in other disciplines can trickle over to better work performance.

Here are ten ways to learn:
1. Learn new programming languages and frameworks
2. Invest in high demand skills (future proofing)
3. Read books (checkout [Books2Rec](https://books2rec.me/) for recommendations!)
4. Join discussion groups or book clubs
5. Attend meetups, talks, and conferences or even just watch them online
6. Network and maintain relationships
7. Follow bloggers that share great knowledge
8. Write to teach. Trying to teach others is by far the best way to learn material yourself. This is my inspiration for this blog!
9. Work on side projects
10. Pursue what you love. Don't waste time on TV, web surfing, or social media

# **Prioritize Regularly**
Success of your company or yourself requires prioritizing the things that actually matter. Prioritizing is a skill like all others. You can get better at figuring out what is important and also estimating how long things will take. 

### Track To-Dos
I use Google Calendar and Google Tasks to track everyting I have to and want to do every day and week. There are thousands of apps that do this or even just keep a journal. 

Learning How to Learn also showed us the importance of writing down To-Dos. Our working memory is a very limited cache so writing things down helps us clear out our cache for more in the moment things and doesn't let us forget future things to do. 

You should also learn to assign priority and estimated time to your to-do items. Don't just brain dump them. Tomorrow you will have to use time to sort through it all!

### Focus on what Directly Produces Value
There are an infinite amount of things you can do at this moment. However, you should do that things that produce the most value. 

A good example Lau provided is saving money. Many people say you should skip the Starbucks $4 coffee every morning as this will save X amount of money a year. However, there are other, shorter (not easier) ways that will save MORE money.
1. Spending an hour or two researching cheaper high expense items like hotel rooms or tickets can save hundreds of dollars.
2. Optimizing your stock and savings into higher return accounts will generate more money than saving on coffee every morning.
3. Negotiating a higher salary can net you tens of thousands of dollars a year for a day's worth of extra effort. 

Of course, saving $4 a day on coffee is still helpful but always look for bigger value items first to tackle!

### Focus on the Important and Non-Urgent
This is the famous Qudrant chart. 
![Priority]({{ "/assets/EffectiveEngineer/quadrant.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="500px" .center-image}

The lesson is that Important and Non-Urgent is JUST AS HIGH PRIORITY as Urgent and Important.

### Protect Your Maker's Schedule
Engineers need long, uninterupted blocks of time to get things done. Limit your interuptions and make it known you need blocks of 'do not disturb' time. This is why working from home can be very helpful.

### Limit Amount of Work in Progress
Our working memory can store 7 +/- 2 chunks. If you have 20 'In Progress' tickets in JIRA, something is wrong. Limit this to 2 or 3.

### Fight Procrastination
My [Learning How to Learn](https://nickgreenquist.github.io/blog/miscl/2018/04/10/Learning-How-to-Learn.html) post has valuable information on this topic, much of which is repeated in this chapter of the book. 

One new piece of advice is to form a plan of when you will do things in the future. The simple fact of planning our future blocks of time to work on something will actually make you 2-3x more likely to do it. 

### Make a Routine
Use the Pomodoro Technique to split up your day into 25 minute productive chunks. Aim to maximize how many Pomodoro blocks you complete each day for high leverage work (25 minutes of answering emails does not count). 

Split up your To-Do list into a 'Doing', 'Today', and 'This Week' sections and shuffle things from one to the next each day. Only assign as many things as can realistically get done per day. 

# **Part 2**
My TLDR of Part 2 will be posted once I finish reading it and when I carve out sime time to do a quick write up. Thanks for reading Part 1!
