Reading is one of the most important parts of my life, and has been since I was a little kid. In this post, I want to list out all the books that I feel have changed my life for the better. I won't summarize or say what the book is about, but only briefly explain how each book changed me. 

This also is not a list of my favorite books (altough many here I would count as such). Instead it is the books that I felt changed me the most after finishing them. 

You can find all the books I have read [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26809953-nick-greenquist?shelf=read).
